# Oracle UEK 5.4.17 build 2136 kernel
### And ZFS 2.1.1+ binaries in rpm packages
---

#### Built with zfs in-tree kernel extensions

Compiled on Oracle 8.4.  This kernel should work on CentOS/RHEL systems too (Rocky, CloudLinux, etc. possibly Fedora, YMMV) 

Running this kernel makes building `initramfs` for ZFS unnecessary

Compiled from OpenZFS repo `HEAD` pull @ 11/6/2021
